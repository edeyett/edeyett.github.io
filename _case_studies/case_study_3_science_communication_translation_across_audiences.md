## WHY — I Communicate Science Because I Love It

I don’t communicate science because it needs to be “made simple.” I do it because science — especially microbiology — is **alive**, weird, beautiful, unsettling, funny, and deeply human.

Microbes are not just units in a methods section. They shape our histories, our food cultures, our diseases, our myths, our fears, our economies, and our futures. They live in our bodies, our soil, our water, our stories. And yet, the way science is often communicated strips all of that away — flattening living systems into sterile summaries or jargon-heavy fragments that leave most people disconnected or intimidated.

My *why* is a combination of **creativity, connection, and care**.

I am driven by a genuine, almost obsessive joy in finding the metaphor that clicks, the story that opens a door, the cultural reference that suddenly makes a microbial process feel intuitive rather than opaque. I love connecting peer‑reviewed literature to pop culture, folklore, history, food, and everyday experience — not to cheapen the science, but to **honor it** by letting it be understood.

This is where my work is different.

If what you want is a purely academic voice that compresses a manuscript into a colorless press release, I am probably not the right fit. But if you want **thoughtful, experimental, culturally aware science communication** — work that preserves rigor while inviting wonder, curiosity, and genuine engagement — that is exactly where I thrive.

This case study captures how I bring scientific discipline, creativity, and passion together to communicate microbiology across audiences, formats, and contexts without ever sacrificing integrity.

## HOW — Translation, Not Dilution

My approach to science communication is intentional and adaptive. The tone shifts. The metaphors change. The framing evolves. The standards do not.

### Core Principles

- **Scientific integrity is non‑negotiable** — fun never comes at the expense of accuracy
- **Audience matters** — communication should meet people where they are, not where we wish they were
- **Metaphor is a tool, not a shortcut** — it clarifies, it does not replace evidence
- **Credibility must be earned** — through research grounding, expert voices, and care

I think deeply about *how* and *why* information moves between people. Good science communication is not about volume or visibility — it is about trust.

Rather than locking myself into a single style or platform, I intentionally explored multiple science communication modes, each designed for a different audience and goal:

- Cultural, narrative‑driven public engagement
- Discipline‑anchored, professional scientific dialogue
- Institutional and applied science communication

Together, these form a flexible, end‑to‑end science communication practice.

## WHAT — Platforms, Projects, and Practice

### Public‑Facing Storytelling: *The Microbe Moment*

**Role:** Creator, co‑host, content architect, interviewer  
**Audience:** General public, students, scientists, science‑curious listeners

*The Microbe Moment* is where my creative scicomm voice is most visible.

Each episode and accompanying blog post was built on **serious research** — typically 10–20 hours per topic — drawing from peer‑reviewed literature, books, and carefully vetted sources. From there, I layered narrative, metaphor, humor, and cultural framing to make complex microbiology feel approachable without flattening it.

Episodes explored microbes through:

- Pop culture and science fiction  
  (*How to Drink Like a Skywalker*)
- History, fear, and folklore  
  (*Vampires of New England: The Undead Panic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis*)
- Food, fermentation, environment, medicine, agriculture, and industry

Formats ranged from interviews and historical storytelling to literature synthesis and thematic deep‑dives.

**Reach & Impact**

- ~100 downloads per episode
- Global audience, with top listener countries including **the USA, UK, Canada, Germany, and Australia**
- Blog posts reaching **tens to hundreds of readers**
- **Corporate sponsorship** from *ZymoBIOMICS*
- Invited to lead **two creative science webinars**
- Managed and produced companion **blog, Instagram, Twitter/X, and Facebook** content

### Discipline‑Anchored Communication: *Microgreens (APS / MPMI)*

**Role:** Host / contributor  
**Audience:** Researchers, graduate students, scientific professionals

*Microgreens* operated at a very different register.

This work was designed for scientists already embedded in research culture. The tone was more technical, the framing more direct, and the conversations anchored firmly in current scholarship and professional practice within plant–microbe interactions.

Here, creativity showed up not as metaphor, but as **clarity** — asking the right questions, guiding conversations, and making complex research legible to peers without oversimplification.

**Example Topic**

- *Using genomics in the fight against citrus greening disease: An interview with Jennifer Lewis*

This work demonstrates my ability to shift voice and depth while remaining credible inside formal scientific spaces.

### Editorial, Institutional, and Applied Science Communication

My science communication work also extends well beyond podcasting:

- **Assistant Feature Editor** for *Phytobiomes* and *Molecular Plant–Microbe Interactions* journals  
  Manuscript review, editorial support, and public‑facing scientific releases

- **Freelance scientific & medical writing**  
  SOP editing, medical writing projects, manuscript review and refinement

- **Conference and community engagement**  
  Assisting with scientific conference organization, blogs, and supporting materials

- **Sustainability communication & education** (UC Riverside)  
  Leading Green Labs certification, workshops, Earth Day events, and serving on campus sustainability committees

Across all of this work, the throughline is the same: care, accuracy, and respect — for the science and for the people engaging with it.

## OUTCOME — What This Work Makes Possible

This body of work demonstrates:

- Credible communication across **public, professional, and institutional audiences**
- Preservation of rigor across wildly different formats
- Engagement driven by curiosity rather than hype
- Trust‑building between scientists and broader communities

Together, these projects show that science communication can be **creative without being careless**, accessible without being shallow, and rigorous without being alienating.

## WHY IT MATTERS — And Who This Is For

This case study anchors **MicroMosaic’s Science Communication & Translation pillar**.

It is for organizations and teams who care deeply about both **accuracy and connection**, including:

- NGOs translating science to funders, communities, or policymakers
- Scientific societies and research organizations
- Mission‑driven companies working at the science–society interface
- Teams seeking blogs, **podcast hosting and production (including new or sponsored shows)**, social media strategy, SOP editing, manuscript review, infographics, or event support

The boundary is clear:

> *This is not hype‑driven science communication.*

It is thoughtful, creative, research‑anchored work designed to help science travel — intact, honest, and alive — across audiences.
