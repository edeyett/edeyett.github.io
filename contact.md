## Start a conversation

Email is the fastest way to reach MicroMosaic. Share context, constraints, and timelines—you don’t need a perfect scope to start.

- **Email:** [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})
- **Typical response time:** 2–3 business days
- **Location:** Remote (Pacific Time) with global collaborators

## What to include (if you can)

1. The scientific or organizational problem you’re trying to solve
2. What data, systems, or communication pieces already exist
3. Desired timelines, audiences, and success signals
4. Any constraints around tooling, security, or collaboration style

Prefer a quick intro call first? Send two or three time windows and we’ll align.
