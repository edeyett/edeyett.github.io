## Data, Bioinformatics & Analysis

MicroMosaic approaches biological data as living context. Every analysis includes interpretation, collaboration with wet-lab partners, and figures ready for manuscripts, decks, or stakeholders.

**Representative work**

- Whole genome, metagenomic, amplicon, and RNA-seq pipelines for bacteria and fungi
- Comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and multi-omics synthesis
- Experimental design guidance, metadata strategy, and QC planning
- Visual and narrative reporting that makes decisions clear

**Collaboration looks like** discovery calls, scoped analyses, and iterative interpretation sessions. Pipelines can be handed off or run as a managed service depending on team capacity.

## Science Communication & Translation

Communication is participatory, not performative. MicroMosaic turns complex results into narratives that maintain accuracy while inviting curiosity.

**Representative work**

- Scientific writing for technical, mixed, and public audiences
- Podcast and audio development, interviews, and sponsored storytelling
- Editorial support for journals, manuscripts, SOPs, and grant narratives
- Workshops on data literacy, interpretation, and collaborative sense-making

**Collaboration looks like** co-developing outlines, scripts, or briefs with your SMEs, layering metaphor only when it clarifies, and providing research-backed storytelling assets.

## Data Strategy, Governance & Leadership

Healthy data ecosystems need shared ownership. MicroMosaic builds the systems, governance, and literacy that keep science reproducible as you scale.

**Representative work**

- Data governance working groups, literacy workshops, and executive alignment
- LIMS/ELN selection, metadata strategy, and cost-aware cloud architecture
- Responsible AI and analytics readiness conversations tailored to your workflows
- Fractional data leadership for teams not ready to hire a full org

**Collaboration looks like** facilitated sessions, playbooks, and roadmaps that turn strategy into practice—always anchored in scientific integrity.

## Engagement Models

- **Scoped Projects:** Clearly defined analyses, reports, or communication assets.
- **Time-Bound Consulting:** Sprint-style advisory support through transitions.
- **Fractional Partnerships:** Embedded collaboration for ongoing oversight, interpretation, or leadership.
