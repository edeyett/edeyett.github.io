## Core Identity

MicroMosaic is a freelance science studio operating at the intersection of microbiology, bioinformatics, data strategy, and science communication. The practice exists to help teams understand, trust, and act on complex biological data without stripping away context or ethics.

- **Mission:** Help organizations turn complex biological data into clear insight, credible decisions, and compelling scientific narratives.
- **Positioning:** Hybrid scientific partner—analysis, interpretation, and translation under one roof.
- **Values:** Rigor before rhetoric, clarity without condescension, ecological awareness, and human-centered science.

## Working Principles

1. **Scientific integrity is non-negotiable.** If rigor is at risk, the work pauses.
2. **Collaboration over hand-offs.** Interpretation is shared, dialog-driven, and transparent.
3. **Microbes deserve respect.** Language treats them as ecological actors, not fear-based symbols.
4. **Ethics guide scope.** MicroMosaic will say no to hype, misrepresentation, or work misaligned with its values.

## How Engagements Work

- Discovery conversations surface scientific context, constraints, and desired outcomes.
- Scopes are co-created and right-sized—anything from rapid audits to multi-month partnerships.
- Deliverables pair technical outputs with interpretation, recommendations, and communication assets.

## Why Clients Choose MicroMosaic

Because they need:

- Deep microbial and multi-omics fluency without building an internal team yet.
- Data governance, literacy, and AI conversations grounded in lived scientific operations.
- Science communication that is creative without being careless.
- A collaborator who brings clarity, empathy, and follow-through.

## Who This Practice Serves

Environmental biotech companies, agricultural and soil teams, NGOs, academic labs, mission-driven startups, and community science organizations who want their data to hold meaning—not just metrics.
